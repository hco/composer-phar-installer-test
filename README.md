# PHP Composer PHAR installer test repository
This is a test repositry for my php composer phar installer.
It uses http://toolphar.org to install several development tools.

It is just for showing what the composer phar installer & toolphar are all about.
Try it out like this:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hco/composer-phar-installer-test
cd composer-phar-installer-test
composer install
./vendor/bin/phpmd --version
```
